        <h1>&lt;abbr&gt;: The Abbreviation element</h1>
        <section>
          <p>The <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langauge">HTML</abbr> (Hyper Text Markup Language) element represents an abbreviation or acronym.</p>
          <p>When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the terms in plain text on first use, along with the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> to mark up the
            abbreviation. This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.</p>
          <p>The optional <code>title</code> attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present. This provides a hint to user
            agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means. If present, <code>title</code> must contain this full description
            and nothing else.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Attributes</h2>
          <p>This element only supports the <a href="../global-attributes/index.html"
               title="Global Attributes"
               hreflang="en"
               target="_blank">global attributes</a>. The <code>title</code> attribute has a specific semantic meaning when used with the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element; it
            <em>must</em> contain a full human-readable description or expansion of the abbreviation. This text is often presented by the browsers as a tooltip when the mouse
            cursor is hovered over the element.</p>
          <p>Each <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element you use is independent from all others; providing a <code>title</code> for one does not automatically attach the same expansion
            text to others with the same content text.</p>

          <h2>Usage notes</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Typical use cases</h3>
            <p>It is certainly not required that all abbreviations be marked with <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>. There are, though, a few cases where it is helpful to do so:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When an abbreviation is used and you want to provide an expansion or definition outside the flow of the document's content, use <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> with an
                appropriate <code>title</code>.</li>
              <li>To define an abbreviation which may be unfamiliar to the reader, present the term using <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> and inline text providing the definition.
                Include a <code>title</code> attribute only when the inline expansion or definition is not available.</li>
              <li>When an abbreviation's presence in the text needs to be semantically noted, the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element is useful. This can be used, in turn, for
                styling or scripting purposes.</li>
              <li>You can use <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> in concert with <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> to establish definitions for terms which are abbreviations or acronyms.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Grammar considerations</h3>
            <p>In languages with grammatical number (that is, language where the number of items affects the grammar of a sentence), use the same grammatical number in your
              <code>title</code> attribute as inside your <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element. This is especially important in languages with more than two numbers, such as Arabic,
              but is also relevant in English.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Default styling</h2>
          <p>The purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author and all browsers display it inline (<code>display: inline</code>) by default, though its
            default styling varies from one browser to another:</p>
          <p>Some browsers add a dotted underline to the content of the element. Others add a dotted underline while converting the contents to small caps. Others may not style it
            differently than a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element. To control this styling, use <code>text-decoration</code> and <code>font-variant</code>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Accessibility concerns</h2>
          <p>Spelling out the acronym or abbreviation in full the first time it is used on a page is beneficial for helping people understand it, especially if the content is
            technical or industry jargon.</p>
          <p>Only include a <code>title</code> if expanding the abbreviation or acronym in the text is not possible. Having a difference between the announced word or phrase and
            what is displayed on the screen, especially if it's technical jargon the reader may not be familiar with, can be jarring. </p>
          <p>This is especially helpful for people who are unfamiliar with the terminology or concepts discussed in the content, people who are new to the language, and people with
            cognitive concerns.</p>
