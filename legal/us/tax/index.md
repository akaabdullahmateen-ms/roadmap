### Non-resident Alien or Resident Aline?

#### Introduction

You should first determine whether, for income tax purposes, you are a non-resident alien or a resident alien. If you are both a non-resident and resident in the same year, you have a dual status.

#### Non-resident Aliens

If you are an alien (not a U.S. citizen), you are considered a non-resident unless you meet either the [Green Card Test](#green-card-test) or [Substantial Presence Test]().

#### Resident Aliens

You are a resident alien of the United States for tax purposes if you meet the either the [Green Card Test](#green-card-test) or [Substantial Presence Test](#substantial-presence-test) for the current calender year (January 1 - December 31). Even if you do not meet either of these tests, you may be able to choose to be treated as a U.S. resident for part of the year. For more information, see [First Year Choice]() under Dual-Status Aliens.

#### Green Card Test

You are a resident for tax purposes if you are a lawful permanent resident of the United States at any time during the current calender year, however, see [Dual-Status Aliens]() for exceptions. This is known as the green card test. You are a lawful permanent resident of the United States at any time if you have been given the privilege, according to the immigration laws, of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant. You generally have this status if the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), or its predecessor organization, has issued you an alien registration card, also known as a green card. You continue to have resident status under this test unless the status is taken away from you or is administratively or judicially determined to have been abandoned.

**Resident status taken away:** Resident status is considered to have been taken away from you if the U.S. Government issues you a final administrative or judicial order of exclusion or deportation. A final judicial order is an order that you may no longer appeal to a higher court of competent jurisdiction.

**Resident status abandoned:** An administrative or judicial determination of abandonment of resident status may be initiated by you, the USCIS, or a U.S. consular officer. If you initiate the determination, your resident status is considered to be abandoned when you file either of the following documents with your USCIS Alien Registration Receipt Card (green card) attached with the USCIS or a U.S. consular officer:

- Form I-407 (Record of Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status)
- A letter stating your intent to abandon your resident status. When filing by mail, you must send by certified mail, return receipt requested (or the foreign equivalent), and keep a copy and proof that it was mailed and received.

Until you have proof that your letter was received, you remain a resident alien for tax purposes even if the USCIS would not recognize the validity of your green card because it is more than 10 years old or because you have been absent from the United States for a period of time. If the USCIS or U.S. consular officer initiates
this determination, your resident status will be
considered to be abandoned when the finalCAUTION
!
administrative order of abandonment is issued.
If you are granted an appeal to a federal court of
competent jurisdiction, a final judicial order is
required.
Under U.S. immigration law, a lawful perma-
nent resident who is required to file a tax return
as a resident and fails to do so may be regar-
ded as having abandoned status and may lose
permanent resident status.
A long-term resident (LTR) who ceases
to be a lawful permanent resident may
be subject to special reporting require-
ments and tax provisions. See Expatriation Tax
in chapter 4.

#### Substantial Presence Test


























##### A. Who Must File

If you are any of the following, you must file an income tax return and pay the tax:

1. A non-resident alien individual engaged or considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States during the year.
2. A non-resident alien individual who is not engaged in a trade or business in the United States and has U.S. income on which the tax liability was not satisfied by the withholding of tax at the source.
3. A representative or agent responsible for filing a return of an individual described in (1) and (2).
4. A fiduciary for a non-resident alien estate or trust.
5. A resident of domestic fiduciary, or other person, charged with the care of the person or property of a non-resident individual.

**NOTE:** If you were a non-resident alien student, teacher, or trainee who was temporarily present in the United States on an "F", "J", "M", or "Q" visa, you are considered engaged in a trade or business in the United States. You must file Form 1040-NS (U.S. Non-resident Alien Income Tax Return) only if you have income that is subject to tax, such as wages, tips, scholarships, fellowship grants, and dividends.

You must also file an income tax return if you want to:

- Claim a refund of over-withheld or over-paid tax.
- Claim the benefit of any deductions or credits. For example, if you have no U.S. business activities but have income from real property that you choose to treat as effectively connected income, you must timely file a true and accurate return to take any allowable deductions against that income.

##### B. Which Income to Report

A non-resident alien's income that is subject to U.S. income tax must generally be divided into two categories:

- Income that is Effectively Connected with a trade or business in the United States.
- U.S. source income that is Fixed, Determinable, Annual, or Periodical (FDAP).

Effectively Connected Income, after allowable deductions, is taxed at graduated rates. These are the same rates that apply to U.S. citizens and residents. Effectively Connected Income should be reported on Page 1 of Form 1040-NS (U.S. Non-resident Alien Income Tax Return). FDAP income is taxed at a flat 30 percent (or lower treaty rate, if qualified) and no deductions are allowed against such income. FDAP income that is not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business should be reported on Form 1040-NR: Schedule NEC (Tax on Income Not Effectively Connected With a U.S. Trade or Business).

##### C. Which Form to File

Non-resident aliens who are required to file an income tax return must use Form 1040-NR (U.S. Non-resident Alien Income Tax Return).

###### When an Where to File

If you are an employee and you receive wages subject to U.S. income tax withholding, or you have an office or place of business in the United States, you must generally file by the 15th day of the 4th month after your tax year ends. For a person filing using a calender year, this is generally April 15.

If you are not an employee or self-employed person who receives wages or non-employee compensation subject to U.S. income tax withholding, or if you do not have an office or place of business in the United States, you must file by the 15th day of the 6th month after your tax year ends. For a person filing using a calender year, this is generally June 15.

File Form 1040-NR at the address shown in the instructions for Form 1040-NR.

###### Extension of Time to File

If you can not file your return by the due date, you should file Form 4868 to request an automatic extension of time to file. You must file Form 4868 by the regular due date of the return.

###### You Could Lose Your Deductions and Credits

To get benefit of any allowable deductions or credits, you must timely file a true and accurate income tax return. For this purpose, a return is timely if it is filed within 16 months of the due date just discussed. The Internal Revenue Service has the right to deny deductions and credits on tax returns filed more than 16 months after the due dates of the returns.

###### Departing Alien

Before leaving the United States, all aliens (with certain exemptions) must obtain a certificate of compliance. This document, also popularly known as the Sailing Permit or Departure Permit, must be secured from the IRS before leaving the United States. You will receive a sailing or departure permit after filing a Form 1040-NC (U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Return), or Form 2063 (Departing Alien Income Tax Statement).

Even if you have left the United States and filed a Form 1040-NC on departure, you still must file an annual U.S. income tax return. If you are married and both you and your spouse are required to file, you must each file a separate return, unless one of the spouses is a U.S. citizen or a resident alien, in which case the departing alien could file a joint return with his or her spouse.

#### Non-resident Aliens - Sources of Income

A non-resident alien (NRA) usually is subject to U.S. income tax only on U.S. source income. The general rules for determining U.S. source income that apply to most non-resident aliens are shown below.
