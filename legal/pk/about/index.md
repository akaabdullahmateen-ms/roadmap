## PTO

Sick days
: Employees are entitled to 24 days of sick leave. Of which, 16 days are at full salary and eight days at 50%. Beyond the initial 16 days, employers can offer employees 75% of their salary for a period of 121 days. In the event of a cancer or tuberculosis diagnosis, 365 days must be granted at 100% of the employee’s regular salary. All sick leave requires a medical certificate as evidence. All benefits relating to sick leave are dependent upon employees having made at least 90 days of contributions in the six months preceding their sick leave.

Maternity leave
: Paid maternity leave is for three months, provided that the employee has worked for her employer for at least four months before giving birth and made at least 180 days of contributions in the year before the due date.

Paternity leave
: Paternity leave amounts to one month following the birth of each of a father’s first three children.

## Termination

Termination Process
: Termination processes vary according to types of contract, reason for termination, the employment agreement, and any collective agreements. Sufficient reason for dismissal must be provided and notice of termination must be in writing.

Notice Period
: One month’s notice must be provided by employers or permanent employees. Employers who do not provide such notice must pay one month’s salary in lieu.

Severance Pay
: Severance pay amounts to 30 days of pay for each year of employment. However, no such payment is required if an employee has been legitimately dismissed for misconduct.

Probation Period
: Typical probation periods in Pakistan are three months.
