    <h1>Basic HTML Animals</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>The Llama</dt>
      <dl>
        Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on
        a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

      <dt>The Anaconda</dt>
      <dl>
        The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, traveling rapidly
        by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
