# Introduction

## Meaning of Statistics

The word *statistics*, which comes from the Latin word *status*  (meaning a political state), originally meant information useful to the state (such as information about the population and armed forces). But this word has now acquired different meanings depending on its context:

- *Statistics (plural)* refers to **numerical facts systematically arranged** (such as statistics of prices, road accidents, or crimes).
- *Statistics (singular)* is defined as the **discipline that includes procedures and techniques to collect, process, and analyze numerical data to make inferences and reach decisions if there is uncertainty**. It should be noted that uncertainty does not imply ignorance but instead refers to the incompleteness and instability of the data available.
- *Statistics (plural)* are **numerical quantities calculated from sample observations**. A single quantity that has been calculated in this manner is called a *statistic* (such as the mean of a sample).

### Use of Statistical Information

The statistical information are used for a variety of purposes:

- Inform general public.
- Explain things that have happened.
- Justify a claim.
- Provide general comparisons.
- Predict future outcomes.
- Estimate unknown quantities.
- Establish relationship between factors.

### Characteristics of Statistics

There are several important characteristic features of statistics:

- Statistics deals with the behavior of aggregates (large groups of data) rather than the individual objects of an aggregate.
- Statistics deals with aggregates of observations of the same kind rather than isolated figures.
- Statistics deals with variability that obscure underlying patterns.
- Statistics deals with uncertainties that result from deficiencies in the process of getting data.
- Statistics deals with characteristics that can be described numerically.
- Statistics deals with aggregates that are subject to randomness.
- Statistical laws are valid on the average and in the long run. There is no guarantee tha a certain law will hold in all cases.
- Statistical results might be misleading and incorrect if sufficient care in collecting, processing, and interpreting the data is not exercised.
