## Linear equation

A **linear equation** is an equation that can be written in the form:

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Linear equation}
a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \dots + a_n x_n = b
\end{equation}
$$

where $x_i$ are variables, $a_i$ are coefficients, and $b$ is a constant.

## System of linear equations

A **system of linear equations** (or a *linear system*) is a set of linear equations that involve the same variables.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{System of linear equations}
\begin{aligned}
a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + &\dots + a_{1n} x_n = b_1 \\
a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + &\dots + a_{2n} x_n = b_2 \\
                          &\vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2 + &\dots + a_{mn} x_n = b_m
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

## Solutions set

A **solution** of a linear system is an ordered tuple $(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)$ such that each equation in the system is satisfied, if the variables $x_i$ are replaced with values $s_i$. The set of all possible solutions of a linear system is called the **solution set**.

A linear system can behave in any one of three possible ways:

- The system has *infinitely many solutions*.
- The system has a *single unique solution*.
- The system has *no solution*.

## Properties

Independence
: The equations of a linear system are **independent** if none of the equations can be algebraically derived from the others.

Consistency
: A linear system is **consistent** if it has at least one solution. A linear system is **inconsistent** if it has no solution.

Equivalence
: Two linear systems are **equivalent** if and only if they have the same solution set.
