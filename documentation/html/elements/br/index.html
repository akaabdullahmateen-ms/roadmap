        <h1>&lt;br&gt;: The Line Break element</h1>
        <section>
          <p>The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is
            significant. A <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element is included at the point where we want the text to break. The text after the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> begins again at the
            start of the next line of the text block.</p>
          <section>
            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p>Do not use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements and use the CSS <code>margin</code> property to
              control their spacing.</p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Attributes</h2>
          <p>This element's attributes include the <a href="../global-attributes/index.html" title="Global Attributes" hreflang="en" target="_blank">global attributes</a>.</p>
        </section>

          <h2>Styling with CSS</h2>
          <p>The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element has a single, well-defined purpose - to create a line break in a block of text. As such, it has no dimensions or visual output of
            its own, and there is very little you can do to style it.</p>
          <p>You can set a <code>margin</code> on <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements to increase the spacing between the lines of text in the block, but this is a bad practice - you
            should use the <code>line-height</code> property that was designed for that purpose.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Accessibility concerns</h2>
          <p>Creating separate paragraphs of text using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> is not only a bad practice, it is problematic for people who navigate with the aid of screen reading
            technology. Screen readers may announce the presence of the element, but not any content contained within <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> elements. This can be confusing and
            frustrating experience for the person using the screen reader.</p>
