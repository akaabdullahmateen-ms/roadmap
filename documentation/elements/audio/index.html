                <section>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources,
                        represented using the <code>src</code> attribute or <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one.
                        It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a <code>MediaStream</code>.</p>
                    <p>In a similar manner to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, we include a path to the media we want to embed inside the <code>src</code>
                        attribute; we can include other attributes to specify information such as whether we want it to autoplay and loop, whether want to show
                        the browser's default audio controls, etc.</p>
                    <p>The content inside the opening and closing <code>&lt;audio&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</code> tags is shown as fallback in browsers that do not
                        support the element.</p>

                            <p>A boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the
                                entire audio file to finish downloading.</p>

                                <p>Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be
                                    avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically
                                    enable it). However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose source will be set at a later time, under user
                                    control. See the <a href="../../guides/autoplay"
                                       title="Autoplay Guide"
                                       hreflang="en"

                            <p>If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control audio playback, including volume,
                                seeking, and pause/resume playback.</p>

                            <p>This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related audio file. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in
                                the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element without being <em>tainted</em>. When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS
                                request (i.e. without sending the <code>Origin:</code> HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted use in
                                <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword <code>anonymous</code> was used.
                                The allowed values are:</p>

                                        a cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the
                                        origin site (by not setting the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin:</code> HTTP header), the resource will be
                                        <em>tainted</em>, and its usage restricted.</p>

                            <p>This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user
                                experience. The default value is different for each browser. The spec advises it to be set to <code>metadata</code>. It may have
                                one of following values:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li><code>metadata</code>: Indicates that only audio metadata (e.g. length) is fetched.</li>
                                <li><code>auto</code>: Indicates that the whole audio file can be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it.</li>
                                <li><em>empty string</em>: A synonym of the <code>auto</code> value.</li>

                                    <li>The <code>autoplay</code> attribute has precedence over <code>preload</code>. If <code>autoplay</code> is specified, the
                                        browser would obviously need to start downloading the audio for playback.</li>
                                    <li>The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute; it is merely a hint.</li>
