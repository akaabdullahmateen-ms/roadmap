# Introduction

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML, or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, color, and font. This separation serves to:

- improve content accessibility
- provide more flexibility and control of presentation characteristics
- enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate stylesheet file which reduces complexity  and repetition in the structural content
- enable the stylesheet file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
