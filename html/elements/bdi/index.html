        <h1>&lt;bdi&gt;: The Bidirectional Isolate element</h1>
        <section>
          <p>The <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> HTML element tells the browser's directional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It is
            particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and does not know the directionality of the text being inserted.</p>
          <p>Bidirectional text is text that may contain both sequences of characters that are arranged left-to-right (LTR) and sequences of characters that are arranged
            right-to-left (RTL), such as an Arabic quotation embedded in an English string. Browsers implement the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm to handle this. In this
            algorithm, characters are given an implicit directionality: for example, Latin characters are treated as LTR while Arabic characters are treated as RTL. Some other
            characters (such as spaces and punctuations) are treated as neutral and are assigned directionality based on that of their surrounding characters.</p>
          <p>Usually, the bidirectional algorithm will do the right thing without the author having to provide any special markup but, occasionally, the algorithm needs help. That
            is where <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> comes in.</p>
          <p>The <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> element is used to wrap a span of text and instructs the bidirectional algorithm to treat this text in isolation from its surroundings.
            This work in two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The directionality of text embedded in <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> <em>does not influence</em> the directionality of the surrounding text.</li>
            <li>The directionality of text embedded in <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> <em>is not influenced by</em> the directionality of the surrounding text.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example, consider some text like: <code>EMBEDDED-TEXT - 1st place</code>. If <code>EMBEDDED-TEXT</code> is LTR, this works fine. But if <code>EMBEDDED-TEXT</code>
            is RTL, then <code>- 1</code> will be treated as RTL text (because it consists of neutral and weak characters). The result will be garbled:
            <code>1 - EMBEDDED-TEXTst place</code>. If you know the directionality of <code>EMBEDDED-TEXT</code> in advance, you can fix this problem by wrapping
            <code>EMBEDDED-TEXT</code> in a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with the <code>dir</code> attribute set to the known directionality. But if you do not know the directionality
            - for example, because <code>EMBEDDED-TEXT</code> is being read from a database or entered by the user - you should use <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code> to prevent the
            directionality of <code>EMBEDDED-TEXT</code> from affecting its surroundings.</p>
          <p>Though the same visual affect can be achieved using the CSS rule <code>unicode-bidi : isolate</code> on a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> or another text-formatting element,
            HTML authors should not use this approach because it is not semantic and browsers are allowed to ignore CSS styling.</p>
          <p>Embedding the characters in <code>&lt;span dir="auto"&gt;</code> has the same affect as using <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code>, but its semantics are less clear.</p>

          <h2>Attributes</h2>
          <p>Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the <a href="../global-attributes/index.html" target="_blank" title="Global Attributes" hreflang="en">global
              attributes</a>, except that the <code>dir</code> attribute behaves differently than normal: it defaults to <code>auto</code>, meaning its value is never inherited
            from the parent element. This means that unless you specify a value of either <code>rtl</code> or <code>ltr</code> for <code>dir</code>, the user agent will determine
            the correct directionality to use based on the contents of the <code>&lt;bdi&gt;</code>.</p>
