## Euclidean vector

A **Euclidean vector** is a geometric object in the Euclidean vector space. It is defined as a directed line segment with an initial point $A$ and a terminal point $B$, and denoted as $\overrightarrow{AB}$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Euclidean vector}
\overrightarrow{AB} =
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
-6
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$

## Tuple

A **tuple** is a finite ordered list of elements. An **n-tuple** is an ordered list of $n$ elements, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.

A tuple is different from a set, since it is finite, ordered, and may contain multiple instances of the same element.

## Real coordinate space

The **real coordinate space** of dimension $n$ is the set $\R^n$ that consists of all n-tuples of real numbers $\R$, that is the set of all sequences of $n$ real numbers.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Real coordinate space}
\R^n = (x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n)
\end{equation}
$$

## Unit vector

A **unit vector** is a vector of length $1$. The **normalized vector** $\hat{\bold{u}}$ of a nonzero vector $\bold{u}$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\bold{u}$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Normalized vector}
\hat{\bold{u}} = \frac{\bold{u}}{||\bold{u}||}
\end{equation}
$$

The term $||\bold{u}||$ is the **Euclidean norm** of the vector $\bold{u}$, which is the square root of the sum of squares of the coordinates of $\bold{u}$.

$$
\begin{equation}
\tag{Euclidean norm}
||u|| = \sqrt[2]{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \dots + x_n^2}
\end{equation}
$$
