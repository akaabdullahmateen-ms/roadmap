# Visa

## Working in the United States

Many non-citizens want to come to the United States to work. A common way to work temporarily in the United States as a non-immigrant is for a prospective employer to file a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on your behalf. If you have the right combination of skills, education, and/or work experience, you may be able to live and work permanently in the United States by seeking an employment-based immigration visa.

If you live outside the United States and want to work in the United States, you generally must apply for a visa from the U.S. Department of State (DOS), unless a visa is not required for people from your country of nationality. In many cases, USCIS must approve your petition before you are eligible to apply to DOS for a visa or seek admission at a port of entry. Before entering the United States, you must present yourself to a U.S. Customs and Borders Protection (CBP) officer and receive permission to enter the United States and engage in your proposed activity.

If you are in the United States in a lawful non-immigrant status that does not provide employment authorization, you generally may apply for either of the following:

- A change of status to a non-immigrant classification that provides employment authorization.
- An adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident. This may be a concurrent filling with an immigrant visa petition or, depending on the circumstances, may require an application to obtain an approved immigrant visa before applying for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.

Depending on the classification you seek, your change or adjustment of status application might require a U.S. employer or other qualified requestor to file an application or petition on your behalf to establish your eligibility before we approve your application. However, if you apply based on certain classifications (for example, an alien with extraordinary ability or as a non-immigrant E-1 or E-2 principal treaty trader or investor), you may be eligible to self-petition, which means filing an application on your own behalf.

Additionally, if you are in the United States, including if you are an applicant for permanent residence or a certain family member of an alien who has lawful non-immigrant status, you may file Form I-765 (Application for Employment Authorization) to request employment authorization and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). You may also apply for an EAD that shows such authorization if your immigration status authorizes you to work in the United States without restrictions.

The conditions you must meet and how long you can work in the United States depend on the type of immigration status the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants. You must comply with all conditions of your employment authorization and the terms of your admission to this country. If you violate any of the conditions, you could be removed from or denied re-entry into the United States.

### Temporary (Non-immigrant) Workers

In order for you to come to the United States lawfully as a non-immigrant to work temporarily, your prospective employer must generally file a non-immigrant petition on your behalf with USCIS. Only a few non-immigrant classifications allow you to work in the United States country without an employer first filing a petition on your behalf. Such classifications include the non-immigrant E-1, E-2, E-3, and TN classifications, as well as, in certain instances, the F-1 and M-1 student and J-1 exchange visitor classifications.

#### Spouses and Children Seeking Dependent Non-immigrant Classification

Spouses and children who qualify for dependent non-immigrant classification of a temporary worker and who are outside of the United States should apply directly at a U.S. consulate for a visa, unless exempt.

Spouses and children requesting a change of status or extension of stay in a dependent non-immigrant classification must file Form I-539 (Application to Extend/Change Non-immigrant Status).

#### Federal U.S. Tax Information

*An alien is any individual who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. national. A non-resident alien is an alien who has not passed the green card test or the substantial presence test.*

Non-citizens employed in the United States may have a U.S. tax obligation. The Taxation for Non-resident Aliens page on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides information about taxation for such an individual.
