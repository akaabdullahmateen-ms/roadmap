# Emoji

An emoji is a pictogram, logogram, ideogram, or smiley embedded in text and used in electronic messages and web pages. The primary function of emoji is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversations. Emojis exist in various genres, including facial expressions, objects, places, weather, and animals. They are much like emoticons except emoji are pictures rather than typographic approximations. The term *emoji*, in the strict sense, refers to such pictures which can be represented as encoded characters, but it is sometimes applied to messaging stickers by extension. Originally meaning *pictograph*, the word *emoji* comes from Japanese *e* (絵) meaning *picture* and *moji* (文字) meaning *character*. The resemblance to the English words *emotion* and *emoticon* is purely coincidental. The ISO 15924 script code for emoji is Zsye.

## Emoticon

An emoticon, short for *emotion icon*, also known simply as an *emote*, is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters, usually punctuation marks, numbers, and letters, to express a person's feeling, mood, or reaction.

The first ASCII emoticons are generally credited to computer scientist Scott Fahlman, who proposed what came to be known as *smileys* in a message on the bulletin board system (BBS) of Carnegie Mellon University in 1982. In western countries, emoticons are usually written perpendicular to the direction of text. Users from Japan popularized a kind of emoticon called *kaomoji*, utilizing the larger character sets required for Japanese, that can be understood without tilting head. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986.

As SMS mobile text messaging and internet became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used in texting, internet forums, and emails. Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation. They offer another range of tone and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication. Emoticons were the precursors to modern emojis, which have been in a state of continuous development for a variety of digital platforms. Today, over 90% of the world's online population uses emojis or emoticons.
