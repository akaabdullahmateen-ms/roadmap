## Introduction

The collection of data often results in massive volume of statistical data. This data is unorganized; hence, it is difficult to examine. The huge data is therefore organized and presented in a form that is more easily understood and interpreted.

## Classification

*Classification* is the process of sorting a set of observations into homogenous classes or groups such that the following rules are satisfied:

- Observations in the same class are similar.
- Observations in each class are dissimilar to observations in other classes.

This classification can be done according to one or more criteria:

One-way classification or simple classification
: The data is sorted according to one criterion.

Two-way classification
: The data is sorted according to two criteria.

Manifold classification or cross classification
: The data is sorted according to more than two criteria.

Arrangement of data according to the values of a *variable* characteristic is called a *distribution*. The criteria for a distribution can be *qualitative*, *temporal*, or *geographical* characteristics.

Spatial or geographical distribution
: The data is sorted according to location.

Time series or temporal distribution
: The data is sorted according to time.
