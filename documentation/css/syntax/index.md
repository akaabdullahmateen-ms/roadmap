# Syntax

The basic goal of Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) language is to allow a browser engine to paint elements of the page with specific features, like color, positioning, or decoration. The _CSS syntax_ reflects this goal and its basic building blocks are:

- The **property** which is an identifier, that is a human-readable _name_, that defines which feature is considered.
- The **value** which describes how the feature must be handled by the engine. Each property has a set of valid values, defined by a formal grammar, as well as semantic meaning, implemented by the browser engine.

## CSS declarations

Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. A property and value pair is called a **declaration**, and any CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out, and to style it.
