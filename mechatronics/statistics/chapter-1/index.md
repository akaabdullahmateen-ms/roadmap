# Introduction

## Meaning of Statistics

The word *statistics*, which comes from the Latin word *status*  (meaning a political state), originally meant information useful to the state (such as information about the population and armed forces). But this word has now acquired different meanings depending on its context:

- *Statistics (plural)* refers to **numerical facts systematically arranged** (such as statistics of prices, road accidents, or crimes).
- *Statistics (singular)* is defined as the **discipline that includes procedures and techniques to collect, process, and analyze numerical data to make inferences and reach decisions if there is uncertainty**. It should be noted that uncertainty does not imply ignorance but instead refers to the incompleteness and instability of the data available.
- *Statistics (plural)* are **numerical quantities calculated from sample observations**. A single quantity that has been calculated in this manner is called a *statistic* (such as the mean of a sample).

### Use of Statistical Information

The statistical information are used for a variety of purposes:

- Inform general public.
- Explain things that have happened.
- Justify a claim.
- Provide general comparisons.
- Predict future outcomes.
- Estimate unknown quantities.
- Establish relationship between factors.

### Characteristics of Statistics

There are several important characteristic features of statistics:

- Statistics deals with the behavior of aggregates (large groups of data) rather than the individual objects of an aggregate.
- Statistics deals with aggregates of observations of the same kind rather than isolated figures.
- Statistics deals with variability that obscure underlying patterns.
- Statistics deals with uncertainties that result from deficiencies in the process of getting data.
- Statistics deals with characteristics that can be described numerically.
- Statistics deals with aggregates that are subject to randomness.
- Statistical laws are valid on the average and in the long run. There is no guarantee tha a certain law will hold in all cases.
- Statistical results might be misleading and incorrect if sufficient care in collecting, processing, and interpreting the data is not exercised.

### Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

Statistics as a subject may be divided into two broad branches:

Descriptive statistics
: The branch of statistics that deals with the concepts and methods related to the description and summarization of the important aspects of numerical data (such as tabular displays, central tendency, and spread of the observations).

Inferential statistics
: The branch of statistics that deals with the procedures for making inferences about the characteristics that describe the large group of data (population) from the knowledge derived from only a part of the data (sample) (such as estimation of population parameters and testing of statistical hypothesis).

| Descriptive statistics | Inferential statistics |
| - | - |
| A sports player wants to find his score average for the last 20 games. | A sports player wants to estimate his chance of scoring based on his current season average. |
| A student wants to describe the variation in his school examination marks. | A student wants to predict the variation in his official examination marks based on the school examination marks. |

### Populations and Samples

A *population* or a statistical population is the set (possibly infinite) of all possible observations relevant to some characteristic of interest. A statistical population may be real (such as the height of all students) or hypothetical (such as all the possible outcomes of a coin toss). The number of observations in a finite population is called the *size* of the population, and is denoted by the letter *N*. The numerical quantities describing a population are called *parameters*, and are conventionally denoted by Greek letters.

A *sample* is a subset of a population. Generally it consists of some observations, but in some cases, it may include the whole population. The number of observations in a sample is called the *size* of the sample, and is denoted by the letter *n*. A numerical quantity calculated from a sample is called a *statistic*, and is conventionally denoted by Latin letters. The information derived from sample data is used to draw conclusions about the population.

### Importance of Statistics

The following functions of statistics indicates its importance:

- Statistics assists in summarizing large sets of data in a form that is easily understandable.
- Statistics assists in designing scientific experiments efficiently.
- Statistics assists in planning surveys effectively.
- Statistics assists in drawing general conclusions and predictions.

The following uses of statistics indicates its importance:

- A businessman, industrialist, and research worker employ statistical methods in their work.
- An administrator, whether in public or private sector, uses statistical data to provide factual basis for a decision.
- A politician uses statistics to get support and credibility for his arguments.
- A social scientist uses statistical methods in various areas of society and economics.
