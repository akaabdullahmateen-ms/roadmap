# Introduction

## Meaning of Statistics

The word *statistics*, which comes from the Latin word *status*  (meaning a political state), originally meant information useful to the state (such as information about the population and armed forces). But this word has now acquired different meanings:

- *Statistics (plural)* refers to **numerical facts systematically arranged** (such as statistics of prices, road accidents, or crimes).
- *Statistics (singular)* is defined as the **discipline that includes procedures and techniques to collect, process, and analyze numerical data to make inferences and reach decisions if there is uncertainty**. It should be noted that uncertainty does not imply ignorance but instead refers to the incompleteness and instability of the data available.
- *Statistics (plural)* are **numerical quantities calculated from sample observations**. A single quantity that has been calculated in this manner is called a *statistic* (such as the mean of a sample).
