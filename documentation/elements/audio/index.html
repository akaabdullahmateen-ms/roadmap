                <section>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> HTML element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources,
                        represented using the <code>src</code> attribute or <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one.
                        It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a <code>MediaStream</code>.</p>
                    <p>In a similar manner to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, we include a path to the media we want to embed inside the <code>src</code>
                        attribute; we can include other attributes to specify information such as whether we want it to autoplay and loop, whether want to show
                        the browser's default audio controls, etc.</p>
                    <p>The content inside the opening and closing <code>&lt;audio&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</code> tags is shown as fallback in browsers that do not
                        support the element.</p>

                            <p>A boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the
                                entire audio file to finish downloading.</p>

                                <p>Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be
                                    avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically
                                    enable it). However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose source will be set at a later time, under user
                                    control. See the <a href="../../guides/autoplay"
                                       title="Autoplay Guide"

                            <p>This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related audio file. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in
                                the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element without being <em>tainted</em>. When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS
                                request (i.e. without sending the <code>Origin:</code> HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted use in
                                <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword <code>anonymous</code> was used.
                                The allowed values are:</p>

                                        a cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the
                                        origin site (by not setting the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin:</code> HTTP header), the resource will be

                            <p>This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user
                                experience. The default value is different for each browser. The spec advises it to be set to <code>metadata</code>. It may have
                                one of following values:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li><code>metadata</code>: Indicates that only audio metadata (e.g. length) is fetched.</li>
                                <li><code>auto</code>: Indicates that the whole audio file can be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it.</li>
                                <li><em>empty string</em>: A synonym of the <code>auto</code> value.</li>

                    <h2>Usage notes</h2>
                    <p>Browsers do not all support the same file types and audio codecs; you can provide multiple sources inside nested
                        <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> elements, and the browser will then use the first one it understand.</p>
                    <p>Other usage notes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you do not specify the <code>controls</code> attribute, the audio player would not include the browser's default controls. You
                            can, however, create your own custom controls using JavaScript and the <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> API.</li>
                        <li>To allow precise control over your audio content, <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> fire many different events. This also provides a way
                            to monitor the audio's fetching process so you can watch for errors or detect when enough is available to begin to play or
                            manipulate it.</li>
                        <li>You can also use the Web Audio API to directly generate and manipulate audio streams from JavaScript code rather than streaming
                            pre-existing audio files.</li>
                        <li><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> elements can not have subtitles or captions associated with them in the same way that
                            <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements can. However, there are workarounds.</li>

                        <h3>Styling with CSS</h3>
                        <p>The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element has no intrinsic visual output of its own unless the <code>controls</code> attribute is
                            specified, in which case the browser's default controls are shown.</p>
                        <p>The default controls have a <code>display</code> value of <code>inline</code> by default, and it is often a good idea that you set
                            the value to <code>block</code> to improve control over positioning and layout, unless you want it to sit within a text block or
                            similar.</p>
                        <p>You can style the default controls with properties that affect the block as a single unit, so for example, you can give it a
                            <code>border</code> and <code>border-radius</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>margin</code>, etc. You can not however style the
                            individual components inside the audio player (e.g. change the button size or icons, change the font, etc), and the controls are
                            different across the different browsers.</p>
                        <p>To get a consistent look and feel across browsers, you will need to create custom controls; these can be markup and styled in
                            whatever way you want, and then JavaScript can be used along with the <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> API to wire up their
                            functionality.</p>

                        <h3>Detecting addition and removal of tracks</h3>
                        <p>You can detect when tracks are added to and removed from an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element using the <code>addtrack</code> and
                            <code>removetrack</code> events. However, these events are not sent directly to the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element itself.
                            Instead they are sent to the track list object within the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element's <code>HTMLMediaElement</code> that
                            corresponds to the type of track that was added to the element.</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt><code>HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks</code></dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>An <code>AudioTrackList</code> containing all of the media element's audio tracks. You can add a listener for
                                    <code>addtrack</code> to this object to be alerted when new audio tracks are added to the element.</p>
                            </dd>
                            <dt><code>HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks</code></dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>Add an <code>addtrack</code> event listener to this <code>videoTrackList</code> object to be informed when video tracks are
                                    added to the element.</p>
                            </dd>
                            <dt><code>HTMLMediaElement.textTracks</code></dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>Add an <code>addtrack</code> event listener to this <code>textTrackList</code> object to be informed when new text tracks are
                                    added to the element.</p>
                            </dd>

                            <h4>Note:</h4>
                            <p>Even though it is an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, it still has video and text tracks, and can in fact be used to present
                                video, although the user interface implications can be odd.</p>

                    <h2>Accessibility concerns</h2>
                    <p>Audio with spoken dialog should provide both captions and transcripts that accurately describe its content. Captions, which are specified
                        using WebVTT, allow people who are experiencing hearing loss to understand an audio recording's content as the recording is being
                        played, while transcripts allow people who need additional time to be able to review the recording's content at a pace and format that
                        is comfortable for them.</p>
                    <p>If automatic captioning services are used, it is important to review the generated content to ensure it accurately represents the source
                        audio.</p>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element doesn't directly support WebVTT. You will have to find a library or framework that provides the
                        capability for you, or write the code to display captions yourself. One option is to play your audio using a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
                        element, which does support WebVTT. </p>
                    <p>In addition to spoken dialog, subtitles and transcripts should also identify music and sound effects that communicate important
                        information. This includes emotion and tone. Square brackets are often used to provide tone and emotional insight to the viewer; this
                        can help establish the mood otherwise provided using music, nonverbal sounds and crucial sound effects, and so forth.</p>
                    <p>Also it's a good practice to provide some content (such as the direct download link) as a fallback for viewers who use a browser in which
                        the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element is not supported</p>
